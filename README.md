# RockPaperSissorApp
The classic rock/paper/scissor game made for you versus the computer.
The computer picks a random action chosen by the random module, and you decide which action to take against it.
Simple if/elif/else statements are used to keep track of what the users outcome of the game is depending on the users pick.
